`CroPlotR` aims at the standardization of the process of analyzing the
outputs from crop model such as
[STICS](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/stics_eng/),
[APSIM](https://www.apsim.info/) or really any model.

> The package is under intensive development and is in a very early
> version. The functions may heavily change from one version to another
> until a more stable version is released.
