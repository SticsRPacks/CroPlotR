`CroPlotR` aims at the standardization of the process of analyzing the outputs from crop model such as 
[STICS](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/stics_eng/), [APSIM](https://www.apsim.info/) or really any model.

> The package is under intensive development and is in a very early version. The functions may heavily change from one version to another until a more stable version is released.

## Installation

You can install the released version of CroPlotR from [Github](https://github.com/SticsRPacks/CroPlotR) either using `devtools` or the lightweight `remotes` package:

* With `devtools`

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("SticsRPacks/CroPlotR@*release")
```
* With `remotes`

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SticsRPacks/CroPlotR@*release")
```

Normaly, all the package dependencies will be installed for CRAN packages.
