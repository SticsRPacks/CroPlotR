Description: CroplotR aims at the standardization of the process of analyzing 
  the outputs of crop models though plots and statistics. Users can generate 
  plots presented in dynamic mode with time on the x axis and any simulated 
  and/or observed variable(s) on the y axis or in scatter mode with simulation 
  on the y axis and observations on the x axis. Users can differentiate 
  simulations and observations depending on the situation, model version, or any
  grouping variable. Thirty two corresponding statistics can be computed in the 
  same manner to assess the quality of the predictions of a model.
