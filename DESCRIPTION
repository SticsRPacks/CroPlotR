Description: CroplotR aims at the standardization of the process of
    analyzing the outputs of crop models though plots and statistics.
    Users can generate plots presented in dynamic mode with time on the x
    axis and any simulated and/or observed variable(s) on the y axis or in
    scatter mode with simulation on the y axis and observations on the x
    axis. Users can differentiate simulations and observations depending
    on the situation, model version, or any grouping variable. Thirty two
    corresponding statistics can be computed in the same manner to assess
    the quality of the predictions of a model.
