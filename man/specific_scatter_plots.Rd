\usage{
plot_scat_mixture_allsit(
  df_data,
  sit,
  select_scat,
  shape_sit,
  reference_var,
  is_obs_sd,
  title = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_data}{A named list of data frame including the data to plot (one df
per situation, or only one df if sit==all_situations)}

\item{sit}{The name of the situation to plot (or all_situations)}

\item{select_scat}{Which data to plot when \code{type= "scatter"}? See details.}

\item{shape_sit}{Shape to differentiate between situations when
\code{all_situations= TRUE}. See details.}

\item{reference_var}{Variable selected on x-axis when type is sca√©tter and
select_scat is res. It is possible to select
between observation and simulation of the reference variable.
(examples : reference_var = "lai_n_obs", reference_var = "mafruit_sim")}

\item{is_obs_sd}{TRUE if error standard deviation of observations is provided}

\item{title}{A vector of plot titles, named by situation. Use the situation
name if \code{NULL}, recycled if length one.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object

A list of ggplot objects
}
\description{
Generate scatter plots for the differents cases handled in CroPlotR
(plant mixture, plot of residuals, plot several simulation results on same graph, ...)
as specitifed by the different arguments.
}
\details{
List of the different specific functions:
\itemize{
\item \code{plot_scat_mixture_allsit}: Generate a scatter plot for the case of
mixture of crops, single simulation version and all_situations in same plot
