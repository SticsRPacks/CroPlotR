\arguments{
\item{obs}{A list (each element= situation) of observations \code{data.frame}s
(named by situation)}

\item{obs_sd}{A list (each element= situation) of standard deviations of
observations \code{data.frame}s (named by situation)}

\item{type}{The type of plot requested, either "dynamic" (date in X, variable
in Y) or scatter (simulated VS observed)}

\item{select_dyn}{Which data to plot when \code{type= "dynamic"}? See details.}

\item{select_scat}{Which data to plot when \code{type= "scatter"}? See details.}

\item{var}{A vector of variables that should be displayed on the graph.}

\item{title}{A vector of plot titles, named by situation. Use the situation
name if \code{NULL}, recycled if length one.}

\item{all_situations}{Boolean (default = TRUE). If \code{TRUE}, plot all
situations on the same graph.}

\item{overlap}{A list of lists containing the variables to represent on the
same graph when \code{type = "dynamic"}.}

\item{successive}{A list of lists containing the situations to be represented
as a contiguous sequence when \code{type = "dynamic"}
(implies that the situations are correctly ordered).}

\item{shape_sit}{Shape to differentiate between situations when
\code{all_situations= TRUE}. See details.}

\item{situation_group}{A list of lists of situations to gather when
\code{shape_sit= "group"}.}

\item{reference_var}{Variable selected on x-axis when type is sca√©tter and
select_scat is res. It is possible to select
between observation and simulation of the reference variable.
(examples : reference_var = "lai_n_obs", reference_var = "mafruit_sim")}

\item{force}{Continue if the plot is not possible ? E.g. no observations for
scatter plots. If \code{TRUE}, return \code{NULL}, else return an error (default).}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. Print information during execution.}

A list of parsed arguments, eventually corrected according to the
compatibility between options.
