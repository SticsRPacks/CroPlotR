  soil,

\arguments{
\item{type}{The type of plot to be generated. Must be one of the plot
types supported by the package. Possibilities include all the \code{type} arguments of
other plot functions.}

\item{soil}{A soil data object.}

\item{weather}{A weather data}

\item{supp_args}{A list of supplementary arguments depending on the plot function called}

\item{situation}{A situation data object.}

\item{histogram}{Draw graph in histogram-like form?}

\item{interactive}{Transform output to an interactive \code{plotly} plot?}

\item{verbose}{Print details on the console while executing the function?}

\item{cumulate}{if cumulate= TRUE, we cumulate the radiation,else FALSE we don't cumulate it, =FALSE by default}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass on to the specific plot function, see details.}

\item{symbol=c("auto", "Year", "Site")}{The \code{symbol} argument can be:
\itemize{
\item "auto" (the default): one year is symboled by one shape and one station is symboled by one color.
\item "Year": one year is symboled by one shape and  all the stations is symboled by one same color .
\item "Site": one station is symboled by one color and  all the years is symboled by one same shape ..
\item "list(â€¦)": A list of lists containing the years or stations to be clustered ,and one shape for each group of years(stations) described by the user.

any of the data objects (soil, weather, ...).

\details{
Use the \code{\link{set_soil}}, \code{{set_weather}} and \code{{set_situation}}
functions to create respective data objects from user-given data. ToDo: Add detail for ...
