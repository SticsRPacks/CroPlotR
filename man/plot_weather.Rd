\arguments{
\item{weather}{A weather data object.}

\item{type}{The type of plot to be generated. Possibilities include
\itemize{
\item \code{"limiting.temperatures"} -- Number of hot days against number of cold days, colour and form show station site and year.
\item \code{"temperature.rainfall"} -- annual average temperature against cumulated rainfall  , colour and form show station site and year.
\item \code{"limiting.rainfall_days"} -- Number of dry days against number of high rainfall days, colour and form show station site and year.
\item \code{"radiation"} --  global radiation of each situation against julian days , site and year.
\item \code{"temperature"} -- temperature (min,max,mean)against julian days, site and year.
\item \code{"cumulated_PET.rain"} -- cumulated_PET" vs "cumulated_rain", colour and form show station site and year.
}}

\item{threshold_Tmin}{The threshold temperature that defines cold days, =0 by default}

\item{threshold_Tmax}{The threshold temperature that defines hot days. =35 by default}

\item{threshold_RainMin}{The threshold rainfall that defines dry days, =-5 by default}

\item{threshold_RainMax}{The threshold rainfall that defines high rainfall days, =20 by default}

\item{situation}{A situation data object.}

\item{histogram}{Draw graph in histogram-like form?}

\item{interactive}{Transform output to an interactive \code{plotly} plot?}

\item{verbose}{Print details on the console while executing the function?}

\item{cumulate}{if cumulate= TRUE, we cumulate the radiation,else FALSE we don't cumulate it, =FALSE by default}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass on to the specific plot function.}

\item{symbol=c("auto", "Year", "Site")}{The \code{symbol} argument can be:
\itemize{
\item "auto" (the default): one year is symboled by one shape and one station is symboled by one color.
\item "Year": one year is symboled by one shape and  all the stations is symboled by one same color .
\item "Site": one station is symboled by one color and  all the years is symboled by one same shape .
\item "list(â€¦)": A list of lists containing the years or stations to be clustered ,and one shape for each group of years(stations) described by the user.
}}
}
\value{
The plot of type \code{type} with data from on the weather data object \code{weather}.
}
\description{
Generates a plot of type \code{type} reflecting weather characteristics of
the weather data object \code{weather}, possibly complemented by information from other
data objects (eg. situation).
}
\details{
Use the \code{\link{set_weather}}, \code{{set_weather}}.
functions to create respective data objects from user-given data.
See vignette 'List of supplied plot types' for all possible plot types.
