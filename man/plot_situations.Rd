\arguments{
\item{...}{Simulation outputs (each element= model version), each being a
named list of \code{data.frame} for each situation.
See examples.}

\item{obs}{A list (each element= situation) of observations \code{data.frame}s
(named by situation)}

\item{obs_sd}{A list (each element= situation) of standard deviations of
observations \code{data.frame}s (named by situation)}

\item{type}{The type of plot requested, either "dynamic" (date in X, variable
in Y) or scatter (simulated VS observed)}

\item{select_dyn}{Which data to plot when \code{type= "dynamic"}? See details.}

\item{select_scat}{Which data to plot when \code{type= "scatter"}? See details.}

\item{var}{A vector of variables that should be displayed on the graph.}

\item{title}{A vector of plot titles, named by situation. Use the situation
name if \code{NULL}, recycled if length one.}

\item{all_situations}{Boolean (default = TRUE). If \code{TRUE}, plot all
situations on the same graph.}

\item{overlap}{A list of lists containing the variables to represent on the
same graph when \code{type = "dynamic"}.}

\item{successive}{A list of lists containing the situations to be represented
as a contiguous sequence when \code{type = "dynamic"}
(implies that the situations are correctly ordered).}

\item{shape_sit}{Shape to differentiate between situations when
\code{all_situations= TRUE}. See details.}

\item{situation_group}{A list of lists of situations to gather when
\code{shape_sit= "group"}.}

\item{reference_var}{Variable selected on x-axis when type is sca√©tter and
select_scat is res. It is possible to select
between observation and simulation of the reference variable.
(examples : reference_var = "lai_n_obs", reference_var = "mafruit_sim")}

\item{force}{Continue if the plot is not possible ? E.g. no observations for
scatter plots. If \code{TRUE}, return \code{NULL}, else return an error.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. Print information during execution.}
}
\value{
A (printed) list of ggplot objects, each element being a plot for
a situation
}
\description{
Plots simulation outputs for one or several situations with or
without observations, eventually grouped by a model version
(or any group actually).
}
\details{
The \code{select_dyn} argument can be:
\itemize{
\item "sim" (the default): all variables with simulations outputs, and
observations when there are some
\item "common": variables with simulations outputs and observations in common
\item "obs": all variables with observations, and simulations outputs when there
are some
\item "all": all variables with any observations or simulations outputs
}

The \code{select_scat} argument can be:
\itemize{
\item "sim" (the default): plots observations in X and simulations in Y.
\item "res": plots observations in X and residuals(observations-simulations)in Y.
}

The \code{shape_sit} argument can be:
\itemize{
\item "none" (the default): Same shape for all situations.
\item "txt": Writes the name of the situation above each point.
\item "symbol": One shape for each situation.
\item "group": One shape for each group of situations described in
\code{situation_group}.
}
}
\note{
The plots titles are given by their situation name.
