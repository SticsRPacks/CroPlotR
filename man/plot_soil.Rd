\usage{
plot_soil(
  soil,
  type = "all",
  symbol = c("auto", "Year", "Site"),
  supp_args = NULL,
  situation = NULL,
  histogram = NULL,
  interactive = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  ...
)

plot__thickness.mswc(soil, histogram, interactive, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{soil}{A soil data object.}

\item{type}{The type of plot to be generated. Possibilities include
\itemize{
\item \code{"thickness.mswc"} -- Soil thickness agains soil maximum water content, colour shows soil organic nitrogen concentration.
}}

\item{supp_args}{A list of supplementary arguments depending on the plot function called}

\item{situation}{A situation data object.}

\item{histogram}{Draw graph in histogram-like form?}

\item{interactive}{Transform output to an interactive \code{plotly} plot?}

\item{verbose}{Print details on the console while executing the function?}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass on to the specific plot function.}

\item{symbol=c("auto", "Year", "Site")}{The \code{symbol} argument can be:
\itemize{
\item "auto" (the default): one year is symboled by one shape and one station is symboled by one color.
\item "Year": one year is symboled by one shape and  all the stations is symboled by one same color .
\item "Site": one station is symboled by one color and  all the years is symboled by one same shape ..
\item "list(â€¦)": A list of lists containing the years or stations to be clustered ,and one shape for each group of years(stations) described by the user.
}}
}
\value{
The plot of type \code{type} with data from on the soil data object \code{soil}.
}
\description{
Generates a plot of type \code{type} reflecting soil charactersitics of
the soil data object \code{soil}, possibly complemented by information from other
data objects (eg. weather, situation).
}
\details{
Use the \code{\link{set_soil}}, \code{{set_weather}}
functions to create respective data objects from user-given data.
See vignette 'List of supplied plot types' for all possible plot types.
